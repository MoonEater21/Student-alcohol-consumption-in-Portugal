By M. Attala R.


Dataset: Student Alcohol Consumption [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption)

Data were obtained in a survey of students in mathematics and Portuguese courses in secondary schools. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students. I use the EDA method and several other methods such as data visualization and k-means.


The libraries used are as follows:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
